<p>Started as a response to the pandemic, Melissa Clark's From the Pantry series says goodbye.</p>

<p>Back in March, during those first terrifying weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, I started writing <br>a series of articles as a way to help cooks figure out how to use the mountain of beans and pasta<br> many of us had manically laid in, in case we couldn't, or didn't feel comfortable, leaving the house.</p>
 
<p>Called From the Pantry, it was intended to provide recipes that were versatile enough to cut <br>down on anxiety-ridden trips to the supermarket, while still being satisfying to eat and calming to <br>cook. The recipes, written narratively, were a real-time kitchen diary, based on what I had in my <br>own pantry, and created with an eye toward giving readers wiggle room to use what was in <br>theirs.
